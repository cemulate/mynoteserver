# My Note Server

A simple, self-hosted note-taking solution with the following key features:

* Typed content comes _first_; full Markdown support
* **First-class support** for math with MathJax, including custom configurations and macros
* Notes are stored as _plain markdown files_ in a single directory with _one_ level of hierarchy: `collection/name`.
* Insert drawings/figures instantly with a button or `ctrl-space`
    * Rich sketch interface with full support for stylus pressure & erasers, colors, etc.
    * **No managing image files and links!** Images are stored _directly_ in the markdown document as an image tag with a data URL, conveniently hidden from view in the editor.
    * Edit images easily by re-opening the sketch area with your cursor on the line of an existing figure tag.
